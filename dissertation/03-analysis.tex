\section{Aims Revisited}

Reviewing the literature reveals that much of the recent work in
garbage collection development has been focused on concurrency, and
obtaining real-time guarantees. The topic of verified garbage
collection has received comparatively little interest, and is perhaps
viewed as something which would be nice in an ideal world, but not as
important as making garbage collectors as fast as possible. This is a
shame, as garbage collection bugs can be a very difficult problem to
detect through testing alone.

There have been a few verified garbage collectors, however these tend
to be proofs for specific extant algorithms, or extraction using very
strict definitions of garbage collection. The former typically cannot,
unfortunately, generalise to other collectors, and the latter makes
generalising to types of collectors other than what the author had in
mind very difficult.

This project explores the route of using generic and flexible
formalisms, not tied to any particular class of collector, and which
can be used for the proof or extraction methods. The aim, through
algorithm/formalism co-design, is to produce:

\begin{itemize}
  \item a generic formalism for garbage collection partial
    correctness, in terms of garbage collection as a function applied
    to the program state;

  \item an illustration of the utility of the formalism by proofs of
    correctness of two simple mark-sweep collectors: one specialised
    for immutable languages, and one more general;

  \item design, proof, and implementation of a copying collector.
\end{itemize}
