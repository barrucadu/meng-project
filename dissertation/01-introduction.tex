\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

As programs become more complicated, we have a greater need for
high-level languages which abstract away from much of the underlying
machine. A key part of such a language is a run-time memory management
system, and in particular the automatic disposal of unneeded allocated
memory: that is, garbage collection.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:intro-motivation}

Garbage collection is an important part of many modern programming
languages, however there is an implicit assumption that it never goes
wrong. It would not be feasible for the programmer to account for all
the ways in which the run-time support system may fail, and doing so
would remove the benefit of using such a language in the first
place. But these systems are not perfect: they are written and tested
by humans, with formal verification being very uncommon.

An arguably better approach is to design a garbage collector which is
then formally verified, in order to be able to definitively eliminate
all bugs from the collector, and so release the programmer from the
possible worry of how it may fail. For total certainty, any
implementation must be proven to be a faithful translation of the
algorithm to machine code, however merely having a verified algorithm
is a good stepping-stone towards this.

\section{Outline}
\label{sec:intro-outline}

Chapter \ref{sec:lit} summarises the historical context and recent
developments in the field of the project are presented, and is built
upon in Chapter 3 where the literature-motivated aims of the project
are presented.

Chapters \ref{sec:marksweep} to \ref{sec:gc} proceed to formalise
partial correctness for garbage collection, by considering
independently mark-sweep and copying collectors, and then abstracting
from the specifics of both to produce a general formalism.

Finally, Chapters \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:conclusion} summarise
the contributions of the project and what remains to be done, as well
as discussing limitations of the work.
