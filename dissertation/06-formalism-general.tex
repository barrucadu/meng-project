\chapter{Partial Correctness for Garbage Collection}

\todo{Outline of partial correctness}

\section{Comparison of Mark-Sweep and Copying Correctness}

\todo{Comparison of approaches}

\subsection{Stages of Garbage Collection}

\todo{Stages all garbage collectors do (perhaps implicitly)}

\section{A Framework for Proof}

\todo{Somewhat more concrete proof obligations which, together, imply
  partial correctness.}

\subsection{Sufficiency of the Framework}

\todo{Proof that the framework works}

\section{Less Strict Collectors}

\todo{Discussion of assumptions (stop-the-world)}

\subsection{Incremental Garbage Collection}

\todo{Transformation to stop-the-world and proof. Remaining out of
  scope proof obligation (all valid interleavings work)}

\subsection{Generational Garbage Collection}

\todo{Generations are subheaps for minor-collection
  correctness. Normal proof for major-collection correctness.}
