\chapter{Correctness of Copying Collectors}
\label{sec:copying}

We shall use the same definitions of the \gls{heap}
(defn. \ref{def:ms-heap}), \gls{cell} (defn. \ref{def:ms-cell}),
\gls{pointer} (defn. \ref{def:ms-pointer}), and reachability
(defn. \ref{def:ms-reachable}) as in the prior chapter. Unfortunately,
the definition of word preservation
(defn. \ref{def:ms-word-preservation}) will have to change, because a
\gls{copying} \gls{collector} renames addresses.

\section{Copying}
\label{sec:copying-copying}

Before presenting a definition of correct copying, I have to highlight
the inadequacies of the \gls{mark-sweep} word preservation. Firstly,
it does not allow for mutation of \glspl{pointer}, which is essential
for a \gls{copying} \gls{collector}, but more subtly, it does not
allow for \glspl{cell} to be relocated. This arises in the $h[w] =
h'[w]$ part of the formalism. If \glspl{cell} can be relocated, then
this makes no sense, as $w$ is a \gls{pointer}, and so $w$ in the new
\gls{heap} is not necessarily the same as $w$ in the old
\gls{heap}. Thus, we also need to be able to find old $w$ values.

\begin{definition}[Correct Copying]
  \label{def:c-correct-copying}
  After garbage collection, no allocated cells have been mutated,
  except in the pointer fields, in which case we apply an address
  translation function $f$.

  \begin{align*}
    \forall c \in h,\ \forall w \in c,\ \alloc{c} & \implies
    \mathrm{type}(w) = \mathrm{pointer} \iff h[w] = f(h'[f^{-1}(w)])\\
    &\quad\land \mathrm{type}(w) \neq \mathrm{pointer} \iff h[w] =
    h'[f^{-1}(w)]
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

I have decided to define correct copying as a word preservation-like
property, rather than define it separately, as what is ``correct
copying'' but a way of correctly transforming the contents and
locations of cells, according to some rule?

are in the right direction.}

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:copying-summary}

In this chapter I highlighted the differences between the formalisms
suitable for \gls{mark-sweep} and \gls{copying} \glspl{collector}:
``correct copying'' replacing word preservation, and the introduction
of ``correct translation'' for \gls{pointer} mutation during
\gls{garbage collection}.

I argued that correctness for a \gls{copying} \gls{collector} comes
down to copying exactly the \glspl{live cell} and updating all
\glspl{pointer} consistently.

I then talked about the Fenichel/Yochelson\cite{Fenichel69} collector,
and provided proofs of its partial and total correctness. These proofs
shall not be referenced in future chapters, and merely serve as an
illustration of the utility of the definition of correctness presented
here. Definitions will be reused, however, in producing an abstract
formalism of garbage collection.
