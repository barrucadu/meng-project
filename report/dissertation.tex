\begin{abstract}
Programming languages with managed runtimes abstract away from much,
sometimes even all, of the need for manual memory management. Whilst
a lot of work has gone into how to make these critical systems
performant, there has not been so much work on formal verification,
and developers often rely on traditional testing and bug
reporting. This is far from ideal, as source-level verification of
software is pointless if the runtime may have arbitrary bugs lurking
within.

In this project, I propose a formalism of partial correctness for
garbage collection, and then show how some common algorithms are
correct under this formalism. Finally, I propose a new garbage
collection algorithm based on a review of the literature, prove that
it is correct, and then measure the performance of a (non-verified)
Java implementation in Jikes RVM.  \vfill

\paragraph{Statement of Ethics}

This project concerns only the development and implementation of
algorithms. No human participation is involved at any point and as
such there are no specific ethical implications.
