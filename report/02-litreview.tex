\chapter{Literature Review}

This chapter reviews the background of the project: the traditional
methods of garbage collection, more complicated collectors, methods of
algorithm and software verification, and current work in the
production of verified garbage collectors.

\section{Garbage Collection}

\subsection{The Traditional Algorithms}

\subsubsection{Reference Counting}

\todo{What it is, when it was introduced, flaws, benefits}

\subsubsection{Mark-Sweep}

\todo{What it is, when it was introduced, flaws, benefits}

\subsubsection{Copying}

\todo{What it is, when it was introduced, flaws, benefits}

\subsubsection{Mark-Compact}

\todo{What it is, when it was introduced, flaws, benefits}

\subsection{Hybrid Collectors}

\todo{Why they are sometimes good}

\subsubsection{Generational Collectors}

\todo{What it is, when it was introduced, flaws, benefits,
  generational hypotheses}

\section{Algorithm Verification}

\todo{What is verification}

\subsection{Verification by Proof}

\todo{How to take some code and a specification and prove the two equivalent}

\subsection{Verification by Extraction from Specification}

\todo{How to refine a specification until we can pluck out code}

\section{Verified Garbage Collection}

\todo{Work on verifying garbage collectors, using either method}
