\chapter{Formalising Garbage Collection}

\section{What Partial Correctness Means}

To precisely formalise garbage collection, we must first informally
determine what the whole process is about. Myreen\cite{Myreen10}
starts by defining the heap as a finite partial mapping from addresses
to a list of pointers and some data. He then proceeds to formalise
garbage collection as a state isomorphism with no garbage cells left
over, however this is a rather strict definition.

\begin{definition}[Weak Garbage Collection (informal)]
  A garbage collector satisfies the weak garbage collection property
  if it is a state isomorphism, where the number of garbage cells in
  the resultant heap is strictly less than in the original heap.
\end{definition}

This may not appear to be terribly useful, but in some cases it is the
strongest statement we can make. For example, in the case of
generational garbage collection, the nepotism effect (tenured garbage
cells pointing to cells in the younger generation) may cause some
cells which are, strictly speaking, garbage to survive a minor
collection. These cells are then collected whenever there is a major
collection, but to say that a generational collects only ``collects''
when the entire heap is examined would be a very strange abuse of
terminology.

\begin{definition}[Strong Garbage Collection (informal)]
  A garbage collector satisfies the strong garbage collection property
  if it is a state isomorphism, where there are no garbage cells in
  the resultant heap.
\end{definition}

This is an English-language restatement of Myreen's formal notion of
garbage collection correctness, which is expressed more precisely in
terms of a filtering function.
